    <p><strong>1. From writing your first fantasy story at six to creating the Diary of a Rich Kid series, how has your writing journey evolved over the years?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Malcolm Mejin :</strong> When I was six, I wrote comic-strip-style adventure stories that were simple and imaginative—complete with tiny grammatical errors, of course! As I grew into my teens and adulthood, my writing matured. I could articulate my ideas more clearly, whether it was exploring fantasy worlds or deeply personal themes like love and betrayal. In my teens, I even wrote a serious novel tackling these heavy topics. But with Diary of a Rich Kid, I wanted to focus on humor, adventure, and suspense—something more lighthearted. Writing this series brought me joy, and I realized that versatility is what keeps me passionate about storytelling.</p>

    <p><strong>2. What inspired you to create the Diary of a Rich Kid series, and how did you come up with the concept for the first book, Lost in Space?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Malcolm Mejin :</strong> I wrote Diary of a Rich Kid in 2017 purely for fun—it was an outlet to destress and channel my creativity. Publishing it wasn’t on my mind until a friend encouraged me, and in 2018, I decided to share it with the world. For Lost in Space, I wanted to push my creative boundaries. My previous books were all Earth-based, so I thought, why not go beyond? Writing about space felt like a fun challenge, and it allowed me to explore a whole new imaginative realm.</p>

    <p><strong>3. You mentioned that the series started as a fun project. At what point did you realize it had the potential to reach a wider audience, and how did self-publishing shape your journey as an author?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Malcolm Mejin :</strong> Self-publishing was an eye-opener. It taught me perseverance, patience, and the nuts and bolts of bringing a book to life—things I might not have learned otherwise. The moment I realized the series had potential was during a school visit. Seeing students’ excitement and enthusiasm for my book made me realize it wasn’t just fun for me—it resonated with them too.</p>

    <p><strong>4. How did your partnership with Penguin Random House SEA come about, and how has working with them impacted your career?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Malcolm Mejin :</strong> In 2021, I submitted my manuscript to Penguin Random House SEA, not expecting much because they receive so many submissions. When they reached out to publish my work, I was over the moon! Working with Penguin has been incredible. Their global presence has allowed me to reach a wider audience, and I’ve gained valuable insight into traditional publishing.</p>

    <p><strong>5. Your school tours are a significant part of your engagement with young readers. What do you enjoy most about these interactions, and what lessons do you hope to impart to the students?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Malcolm Mejin :</strong> I love meeting readers and hearing how my books have impacted them. Their stories inspire me just as much as mine inspire them. Through these interactions, I hope to encourage students to pursue their dreams, no matter how big or small, and to believe in themselves.</p>

    <p><strong>6. What challenges did you face while transitioning from self-publishing to working with a major publishing house?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Malcolm Mejin :</strong> One difference is creative control—self-publishing gives you full control but also means you handle everything yourself, from marketing to distribution. With a major publisher, some of that workload is lifted, which lets me focus more on writing. For me, it’s a win-win situation.</p>

    <p><strong>7. The Diary of a Rich Kid series has a humorous and relatable tone. How do you ensure your stories connect with young readers on a deeper level?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Malcolm Mejin :</strong> While the stories are lighthearted, I make sure each book has life lessons woven in—whether it’s about friendship, kindness, or courage. These lessons add depth and make the stories more meaningful to readers.</p>

    <p><strong>8. What role did your friends and family play in encouraging you to publish your work, and how important is their support in your creative process?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Malcolm Mejin :</strong> At first, my friends and family didn’t push me to publish, but they saw how passionate I was and eventually gave me their full support. Their encouragement means the world to me—it’s a reminder that I’m not alone on this journey.</p>

    <p><strong>9. Are there any authors or books that have greatly influenced your writing style or inspired the Diary of a Rich Kid series?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Malcolm Mejin :</strong> Definitely! The Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew series, along with R.L. Stine’s middle-grade horror books, have been big influences. Their mix of mystery, suspense, and adventure shaped the way I approach storytelling.</p>

    <p><strong>10. What advice would you give to aspiring authors, especially young writers, who dream of publishing their stories one day?</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Malcolm Mejin :</strong> Don’t give up. Stay consistent. And don’t let anyone tell you your dream is too small—because even a tiny seed can grow into a big, beautiful tree.</p>
