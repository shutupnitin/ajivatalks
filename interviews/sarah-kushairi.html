        Sarah Kushairi is a clinical pharmacist and lecturer from Malaysia who never quite
        shook off her childhood dream of becoming a writer. Armed with a Bachelor of Pharmacy
        (Honours) from International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) and an MSc in Clinical
        Pharmacy from University College London (UCL), she splits her time between the world of
        pharmaceuticals and storytelling.
      </p>

      <p>
        At twelve, Sarah ambitiously started her first Harry Potter-inspired novel. Two chapters
        in, she decided to “come back to it later”—she never did. But her love for writing found
        other outlets. Her health and beauty articles have appeared in Malaysian newspapers, and
        she’s shared her expertise on TV and radio.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her personal piece <em>“Tudung Mana?”</em> was featured in the anthology
        <em>Hijab: Everyday Stories of Muslim Women from Singapore and Beyond</em>
        (Helang Books, 2023).
      </p>

      <p>
        When Master’s coursework at UCL became overwhelming, Sarah turned stress into creativity,
        self-publishing her first travelogue <em>Snippets of Travels: Musings and Travelogues
        across 5 Countries</em> (Amazon KDP, 2024). Her upcoming non-fiction book
        <em>The Art of Embracing Failure</em> (Karangkraf, 2025) explores finding strength in setbacks.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Jannah is ^NOT Average</em> marks her return to fiction—her debut novel inspired by true
        stories from her days as a science stream student in 2006–2007 Malaysia. Sometimes the best
        stories come from writers who’ve taken the long way around.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Ajiva Talks:</strong> Sarah, you’re a clinical pharmacist, lecturer, and now an author—how do you balance science and storytelling in your life?</p>

      <p><strong>Sarah Kushairi:</strong> I would like to say “I don’t. I’m really tired!”—just like that one famous interview on the internet. Hahahah.</p>

      <p>
        Okay, let’s get serious. For me, after-working hours, weekends, and public holidays are very
        precious. I try not to bring work matters home. I optimise my working hours towards doing
        only work stuff. Once I’m home, I dedicate my time to my passions—reading, writing, crafting,
        playing musical instruments, or just relaxing and watching Netflix.
      </p>

      <p>
        I feel it’s important to create a barrier between your “profession” and “passion” hours,
        so you can really focus on each in their specific time.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Ajiva Talks:</strong> What role did your late grandmother’s words, “Be someone who’ll make me proud,” play in shaping your journey?</p>

      <p><strong>Sarah Kushairi:</strong> In <em>Jannah is ^NOT Average</em>, it was her late grandmother who inspired her. In my own journey, it was my late mother.</p>

      <p>
        Growing up, I never really felt immense pressure to make her proud. She wasn’t too strict
        or harsh on me or my siblings—and yet we turned out well. I think she had always been proud
        of us, no matter how small the achievement.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even when she’s no longer here, I’ll try my best to make her proud. That means continuing
        to do my best and being resilient when facing adversities.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Ajiva Talks:</strong> You started writing at 12 with a Harry Potter-inspired novel. How did that early spark influence your later writing?</p>

      <p><strong>Sarah Kushairi:</strong> When I was a teenager, I loved fantasy and magical stories. But later I realised that life isn’t easy—especially as an adult with responsibilities.</p>

      <p>
        I wanted to write something that could comfort or motivate people, something that makes
        them feel seen and heard. Doing this heals me as well. I believe that when you help others,
        you’re also helping yourself.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Ajiva Talks:</strong> Your upcoming book, <em>The Art of Embracing Failure</em>, explores setbacks. What led you to this theme?</p>

      <p><strong>Sarah Kushairi:</strong> A friend once told me, “It’s nice being you,” and I was puzzled.</p>

      <p>
        People only see what we choose to display publicly. They don’t see the hurdles and setbacks
        we’ve had to overcome. The reason people appear successful is because they managed to win
        their unseen battles.
      </p>

      <p>
        This book is my way of helping others embrace failure and move forward, and to live life
        to its fullest.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Ajiva Talks:</strong> Looking ahead, do you see yourself focusing more on fiction or non-fiction?</p>

      <p><strong>Sarah Kushairi:</strong> Both, of course! Fiction and non-fiction are equally important.
        Fiction teaches us things that non-fiction can’t. So I have to write both.
