          <p>Kantarin Leelahuta is a prolific Thai novelist whose journey in storytelling began at an incredibly young age.

Writing under the pen name Pretty Princess, she has since published over seventy titles, capturing the hearts of readers across Thailand and beyond.</p>

          <p>Her works span a variety of genres, but one consistent factor is their widespread popularity. Many of her novels have been adapted into television dramas, solidifying her status as a powerhouse in the Thai entertainment industry. Among her most notable adaptations is ONE NIGHT STAND, which was transformed into a TV series in 2023. Other fan-favorite adaptations include Oh My Boss (2021), Girl Next Room (2020), and Boy For Rent (2019), all of which gained significant viewership and critical acclaim.</p>

          <p>Beyond her success as a novelist, Kantarin's passion for storytelling extends to her academic background. She graduated from Thammasat University with a Bachelor of Arts, majoring in Journalism, a field that further refined her ability to craft compelling narratives. From the moment she first put pen to paper, she never doubted that writing was her calling. Her unwavering dedication to her craft has allowed her to consistently produce engaging stories that resonate with readers of all ages.</p>

          <p>Despite her many achievements, Kantarin remains as ambitious as ever. She has set her sights on an impressive milestone—publishing her 100th book. Her love for writing continues to fuel her creativity, and she shows no signs of slowing down.</p>

        <div class="qa-section">
          <div class="question">Your journey as a novelist started at the remarkable age of 12. How did you discover your passion for storytelling so early, and what inspired you to begin writing?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p class="answer-intro">Kantarin:</p>
            <p>I began my journey as a reader, all thanks to one book my parents bought me on a whim—Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. It wasn't even the first book in the series, but something about it captivated me. After that, I decided I wanted to be a witch, to enroll at Hogwarts. I begged my parents to buy me the rest of the books, and from there, I was hooked—immersed in the world of words. Late at night, when the house was quiet and the adults were asleep, I would curl up with The Lord of the Rings, the dim glow of a small lamp lighting the pages. My writing "career" began even earlier than that, before I turned 12. I was so taken with writing that I created a "class magazine" for my primary school classmates. I sold copies for just 10 THB each—barely covering the cost of ink and paper, but my parents, kindly indulging my passion, let me get away with it. As I grew older, a friend recommended a Korean novel translated into Thai—a teen romance. I fell completely in love with it. It inspired me to write something that would leave an impact, something that might even make someone cry. That's when I started writing romance novels, posting them online, until eventually, I received offers from Jamsai Publishing. At the time, it was a small publisher, but it grew to become one of the largest and most influential publishers in Thailand today.</p>
          </div>

        <div class="qa-section">
          <div class="question">With over 70 published titles, how do you consistently find fresh ideas and inspiration for your novels, including One Night Stand?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p class="answer-intro">Kantarin:</p>
            <p>Over the years, I've seen my writing style evolve, yet the core remains unchanged. The story has to be one that I must write, something that calls to me from within. I need to feel a true connection to the characters and the narrative, or I can't bring myself to write it. There's no forcing it. I wait for those rare, electrifying moments—those "EUREKA" flashes—that spark something deep inside me, and once that happens, the words flow. It's as if the characters themselves become real, and I'm simply here to retell their stories, using nothing but these letters on the page. I let myself drift with the ideas, with the emotions, following wherever they lead. Most of my stories come from the everyday things I encounter—whether it's a simple exchange or a major life event. Anything can serve as the spark that ignites that "EUREKA" moment. Life itself provides all the raw material I need. I don't often follow trends, not because I'm opposed to them, but because I can't. It's not in my nature to chase what's popular. My stories have to resonate with me at a deep, personal level, in that particular moment of my life. I suppose you could say I'm a rather picky author. But the beauty of it is that every story I write is a masterpiece in its own right, born from the depths of my heart and soul, and I wouldn't have it any other way.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-section">
          <div class="question">Your book One Night Stand is a gripping mystery with complex characters. What inspired you to write a story about fame, secrets, and betrayal?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p class="answer-intro">Kantarin:</p>
            <p>I think it's something many of us—myself included—secretly long for. It's a glimpse of something unattainable, a fantasy we can never fully experience, but one we can live through the eyes of relatable characters. And it's easier to draw people in when they're promised something beautiful, something that shines on the surface. But then, as the story unfolds, they're confronted with unexpected twists and betrayals, and suddenly, they're caught in a web with no easy escape. It's only when they're fully immersed in the truth that they realize how deeply they've been drawn in.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-section">
          <div class="question">The three protagonists in One Night Stand—Gale, Papang, and Queen—are so distinct yet interconnected. How did you approach creating these multifaceted characters and their relationships?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p class="answer-intro">Kantarin:</p>
            <p>For me, the complexity of humans, particularly women, is something that has always fascinated me. We are incredibly strong, yet there's a fragility to us too. We can bear the weight of the world and hold onto countless secrets, but we're also deeply vulnerable to our desires. My co-author, Baison, who wrote the original novel in Thai with me, and I decided to let female protagonists narrate the story because their voices are uniquely powerful, distinct, and full of depth. It's a reflection of our own lives and relationships—how many of us truly share our entire selves with even our closest friends? How many secrets do we keep from the people we love, and why? I believe that we all wear masks—different ones for different people. There's the mask we wear for acquaintances, the one we put on for friends, for family, and sometimes, the one we wear when we're alone with no one to see. It's this duality that I find so compelling: the layers we hide behind and the truths we conceal. That's what led us to create the intricate, sometimes messy friendships between the three girls—Queen, Gale, and Papang. Each of them reflects a different part of that complexity, a blend of vulnerability and strength, and the emotional unraveling that comes when those secrets are laid bare.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-section">
          <div class="question">The TV adaptation of One Night Stand was released in 2023. How involved were you in the adaptation process, and how did it feel to see your story brought to life on screen?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p class="answer-intro">Kantarin:</p>
            <p>Once the contract was signed, I passed the baton to the producers and screenwriters. I have deep respect for their craft; they are experts in what they do, and I trust them completely. After all, they chose to adapt the book into a series because they saw something in it, something that spoke to them. That gave me confidence that they would breathe new life into the story in ways I could never have imagined. Watching the series unfold on screen was an absolute joy. The cast was incredible—they seemed to step right out of the pages. The producers and directors managed to preserve the heart and essence of the original while adding their own unique touches, making it something special for both fans of the book and newcomers alike. I truly appreciated every moment of the journey.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-section">
          <div class="question">Your works often delve into themes of love, betrayal, and identity. How do you balance entertainment with thought-provoking narratives that resonate with readers?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p class="answer-intro">Kantarin:</p>
            <p>For me, it all begins with the characters. I put everything into building them as real, relatable, and deeply human. Each one has their own flaws, secrets, hopes, dreams, fears, and desires—just like any of us. The more vulnerable a character is, the more readers can see themselves in them, because these traits are rooted in the realities of human life. Some might argue that fiction is just an exaggeration of reality, but I disagree. Life itself is full of surprising twists and turns—things you couldn't even make up if you tried. So, I take the small, often overlooked moments in our everyday lives and weave them into stories. In doing so, I hope to draw readers in without them even realizing it, making them see the beauty and depth in the simplest of things.</p>

          <div class="question">You've had several successful book-to-TV adaptations. What do you think makes your stories particularly suited for the screen?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p class="answer-intro">Kantarin:</p>
            <p>I believe the reason my work resonates is because I stay true to my own voice. I created something that truly reflects what I wanted to express, and I think that authenticity shines through in the pages. I poured my heart and soul into the story, and in doing so, I gave the book its own life. There's a unique tone and perspective in my writing that sets it apart, even in a world filled with countless wonderful books. The characters and the narrative themselves have their own focal points, ones that seem to catch the attention of those who produce stories. Perhaps it also has something to do with my willingness to step outside the familiar, to not always follow the norms or trends. I trust my instincts, taking chances on themes that are daring or unexplored—ones that I feel might spark curiosity in others. Writing, for me, has always been about pursuing what intrigues me, and in that, I hope to offer something fresh and honest.</p>

          <div class="question">You've spoken about your goal of publishing 100 books. What drives your incredible productivity, and how do you maintain your passion for writing after so many years?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p class="answer-intro">Kantarin:</p>
            <p>At first, my goal was simple: to write a story of my own. But over time, that goal transformed into something deeper—a desire to leave behind my name, my legacy. I want to be remembered, even after I'm gone. I want my voice to linger in this world long after I take my last breath. As I approach a new milestone—soon to publish my 80th book—I feel a quiet sense of pride. It's been a journey marked by both triumph and struggle, yet here I am, still writing. Despite the hardships, despite the loneliness that has often shadowed me over the years. And when I say loneliness, I mean the solitude that comes with the writer's life. Most of the time, I find myself alone with my thoughts, wrestling with the words, questioning which path to follow next. It's both comforting and terrifying. There's no one else to guide me, no one else to tell me what's right or wrong. It's just me, navigating the maze of sentences and paragraphs, piecing together a story without knowing where it will ultimately lead. Writing demands an unwavering faith, a deep well of willpower, and an unrelenting passion. It's not just what I do—it's who I am. I can't imagine my life without it. But like any true love, it's complicated. It's a love-hate relationship, one that pulls me in and pushes me away. Some days, the blank page feels like an insurmountable mountain, and writer's block can feel suffocating. But then there are days when the world feels right. When I hold a finished book in my hands, or when a reader's comment reminds me of the impact my words can have. Those moments make it all worthwhile. So, despite the struggles, despite the fear and uncertainty, writing fulfills me in ways nothing else can. And as long as there's even one reader out there waiting for my words, I will keep writing. Because, in the end, this is my calling, and it's one I will never stop answering.</p>

          <div class="question">Living in Singapore while missing your 20 cats in Bangkok must be challenging. How does your current environment influence your writing, and do you incorporate any aspects of your life into your stories?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p class="answer-intro">Kantarin:</p>
            <p>I've spent most of my life living abroad. During high school, I spent a year in Alaska as an exchange student, and after graduating from university, I moved to Osaka to study Japanese. A brief stint working in Thailand followed, and now, here I am in Singapore, where I've lived since 2019. Over the years, I've grown accustomed to living alone, far from family and friends, but there are still moments when loneliness and homesickness creep in. Despite that, I believe that living in different countries, immersing myself in various cultures, and meeting so many different people have all played a significant role in shaping my writing. They've contributed to who I am today—a unique individual whose experiences no one else can replicate. I've had the chance to encounter a wide range of emotions, from moments of joy to times of hardship, and I know these experiences, both the highs and the lows, have been essential to my growth as a writer. I firmly believe that everything that happens, good or bad, has value. Whether I learn from it or use it as material for my stories, it's all part of my journey. You might find pieces of my life hidden in my books, though sometimes I tuck them away so well that only the most discerning reader might spot them. Hehe.</p>

          <div class="question">Looking ahead, what can your readers expect from you next? Are there any exciting projects or genres you're exploring for your upcoming books?</div>
          <div class="answer">
            <p class="answer-intro">Kantarin:</p>
            <p>As I've mentioned before, I will never stop writing, but each book has its own time. I can't promise an exact release date, but I can assure you that there are some very exciting things on the horizon! Right now, I'm working on a new manuscript—a historical romance set in Thailand during World War II. It's been an immersive process, filled with plenty of research, but I'm enjoying every moment of it. On top of that, I'm thrilled to announce that I'll be having book talks in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore this April and May! For those who are interested, I'd love for you to join me at these exclusive panels where I'll be sharing even more intimate stories and behind-the-scenes insights. Stay tuned and be sure to follow my Instagram for the latest updates!</p>
